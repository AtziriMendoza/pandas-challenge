Module 4

The school data that was analyzed allowed us to manipulate the data to get multiple insights from two CSVs, "school_complete.csv" and "students_complete.csv".

In order to properly get insights from the data we had to organize the data by creating multiple objects and data frames that allowed us to form data frames that grouped and binned the data in ways to be able to get actionable insights from the data that was collected of the schools.

Based on the analysis, it seems like the best amount to spend on a student would be less than $585 in order for the overall math and reading scores to be higher as well as the overall passing rate. This is surprising because you would think that the more that is spent on students the better the students will perform. There seems to be other variables at play that affect the students overall performance. I looked at the other factors like the size of the school and the school type and noticed that these factors play a significant role in student performance.

The smaller the student population is the higher the scores are. The medium size schools around 1000-2000 have about the same percentage in reading, math, and passing rates as small schools that are less than 1000, the difference between the students performance in these two is insignificant. Larger schools of about 2000-5000 tend to be significantly worse in all aspects in comparison to medium-sized and small-sized schools. 

Last but not least, charter schools tend to perform significantly better than district schools based on the reading, math, and passsing rates.

In conclusion, the best indicator of how a student is going to perform is based on whether the student goes to a charter or district school and then secondly on the size of the school. If the school is larger the student will tend to perform worse than if the student is in either a small-sized or medium-sized school.
